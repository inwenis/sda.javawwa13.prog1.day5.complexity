# Computional Complexity

This repo demonstrates the concept of computional complexity by comparing how much time it takes to find a value in an `unsorted array` and `unbalanced binary search tree`.

Sample results below.

Note that this is a `unbalanced binary search tree` thus the results are not so beautifully simillar to a `log2(n)` function. Searching for a values in a `*balanced* binary search tree` should be closer to a `log2(n)` function.
